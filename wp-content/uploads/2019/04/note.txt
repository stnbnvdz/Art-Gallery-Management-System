DESCRIPTION:

Photography: Full spectrum on Canvas, Paper.

STAIR is one of an awesome Winter Collection in the same Color Style. The Details from the Tree and the Brunches are stunning. 

Digital Photography is the first part of creating Artworks like this. The next thing ist to find out what are the tecnical possibillitys of each Picture. Because i work in 99% only with the Colors and not with Picture composition changes. I made it and i respect the awesome Nature and in my Artwork is the Nature untouched! All of my artworks are availeble as FineArt Print on best Hahnem√ºhle Papers, Canvas Prints, Wallpaper Prints and coming soon as Prints on very exclusive and luxury Papers from the Worlds best Paper Manufactures in Germany, Italy, France and the USA. Visit www.visueller.de at the end of May this year and be inspired by my awesome selections, collections and combinations with your loved Artwork or your own loved Pictures.
