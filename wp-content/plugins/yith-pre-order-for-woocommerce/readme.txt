Allow your customers to pre-order their long-awaited product before it's made available and increase sales that could be otherwise lost for ever.

== Description ==

Do you want to sell products that are not on stock yet, but you know that you'll have them?
Pre-Order is the solution for you. Customers will be able to buy your products, despite knowing that you haven't them yet. It's better than not
selling them at all!
All you have to do is: mark the products (simple product or the specific variation) as "Pre-Order" and give them an 'additional stock' that you
know you'll have. In addition, customers will see a customizable message on the Add to cart button, like "Pre-Order this product now!".
Then, customers will be able to purchase the products, and you'll receive an email any time a Pre-Order product is sold.

Increase your sales with Pre-Order!
